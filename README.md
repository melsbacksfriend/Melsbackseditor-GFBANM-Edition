# Melsbackseditor-GFBANM-Edition
A (failed) attempt at custom SwSh animations.  PR if you fix it.  
Animations made using this program will crash the game and yes, I even replaced the bones in the model.  
This was tested modding in Sceptile using Lucario as a base.  
If flatc fails, then replace the really big negative number causing it to fail with 0.  
Subtract one ONLY from the starting lines.  NOT THE ENDING LINES!  
Requirements for the PR: 
1. Still written in C++
2. Has comments to help me understand the changes
3. Either only uses the standard library or you provide a link to a tutorial on any libraries used
4. Still has Lifelight references
